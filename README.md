## How to request (or contribute!) a new airfield
Open a [issue](https://github.com/tkaiser/wbdq/issues/new) with the airfields
- ICAO code
- Name
- Link to the current webcam image

## Ideas / improvements

- support iframe/youtube/stream embeds for webcams (vienna, innbruck, ...)
- Add tagging and filtering (by state/country, east/west/south/north) of airfields
- Add links to websites of airfields instead of linking to webcam pic
- Add VFR/IFR/etc colored badge according to [CheckWx](https://www.checkwxapi.com) API or other METAR source
